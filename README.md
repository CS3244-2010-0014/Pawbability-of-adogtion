## About The Project

Some animals seem to be able to get adopted easily into their forever homes,
while others only have bleak futures ahead of them as they continue to remain in the shelter. 

Hence to help these poor animals find their families, we have developed 2 machine learning prediction models
to deduce the factors that can improve their adoptability.  

### Built With
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Keras Xception](https://keras.io/api/applications/xception/)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data)
