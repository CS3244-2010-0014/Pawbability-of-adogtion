## About The Project

Some animals seem to be able to get adopted easily into their forever homes,
while others only have bleak futures ahead of them as they continue to remain in the shelter. 




Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
